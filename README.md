The source code itself doesn't include the textures that are built in into the pre-release file ".pck" so building it would be useless unless replaced.
Installing the v0.1 of the game needs to include 2 files in one folder which are the ".exe" file itself and ".pck" file that includes the textures and materials for the game.
